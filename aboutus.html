    A tech website refers to any business that provides a digital technical product or service. Often, companies that rely heavily on the use of technology also refer to themselves as tech businesses.

    Today, the term encompasses many businesses, in addition to well-known tech giants like Apple, Samsung and Microsoft.
    
    At Digital Silk, we specialize in creating custom website solutions for tech companies.
    
    While we take in consideration all of the direct and indirect competitors when defining our website projects, we do put our users firsts. And whatever we create is built with the end user in mind.
    
    In fact, as a website user, you can help us to figure out which aspects of a website matter the most!
